# Figure Contract

**Historical report-layout reference:** The upstream Stormy-drawing
`tools/plotting/SKILL.md` is now AICC's default for newly generated and
redrawn figures. If older guidance below conflicts (font choice, grid,
open/closed axes, multi-panel assembly, panel labels, 16:9 canvas,
palette or QA), **use the plotting Skill**. This reference remains only
to interpret/reproduce older report packages; it does not authorize
a second competing style.


> Load this before designing, plotting, rendering, or assembling a report-ready figure.
> A figure contract turns a figure from a result collage into a traceable visual
> argument. It is useful for reviewer responses, manuscript support, exploratory
> research reports, benchmarks, and method-validation packages.

## Core rule

Every report-ready figure must answer one question before it is drawn:

```text
What scientific point is this figure responsible for showing, and what evidence
inside the figure supports that point?
```

Reviewer comments are one possible driver, but not the only one. Generic reports use
the same contract with research questions, manuscript claims, benchmark cases,
method-validation tasks, or exploratory hypotheses.

## Minimal schema

Use YAML, JSON, or a Markdown table, but keep these fields visible beside the figure
artifact or report manifest.

```yaml

## Driver types

Use `scientific_drivers` to make the contract work outside peer review:

| `driver_type` | Use when |
|---|---|
| `reviewer_comment` | The figure answers a specific reviewer comment. Keep `driver_id` stable, e.g. `R2.C4`. |
| `research_question` | The figure answers the project's own scientific question. |
| `manuscript_claim` | The figure supports, limits, or revises a manuscript statement. |
| `benchmark_case` | The figure documents a benchmark task or comparison arm. |
| `method_validation` | The figure validates a method, model, dataset, or workflow. |
| `exploratory_analysis` | The figure is interim evidence used to decide what to compute next. |

`linked_reviewer_comments` may be used as a shorthand in review-response packages, but
do not make it required in generic reports. The required field is the broader
`scientific_drivers` list.

## AICC figure archetypes

Pick the closest archetype before choosing panel sizes and order. These are starting
points, not a closed taxonomy. For mixed figures, select one hero panel; validation
panels should support the hero panel rather than compete with it.

| Archetype | Typical panels | Primary use |
|---|---|---|
| `structure-model` | clean structure render, top/side views, labeled active site, cell/coverage annotation | Establish what atomistic model was actually computed before any property is interpreted. |
| `model-plus-energy` | structure render + relative energy / adsorption / binding / formation-energy table or plot | Show what model was computed and the energy comparison behind a claim. |
| `thermochemistry-free-energy` | reaction/adsorption/free-energy diagram, reference-state table, correction breakdown | Report Delta E/Delta G, ZPE/entropy/chemical-potential corrections, or gas/reservoir thermodynamics. |
| `surface-stability-phase-diagram` | surface structures + surface energy / Pourbaix / chemical-potential / Wulff or coverage diagram | Support phase, termination, defect, coverage, or stability claims under conditions. |
| `electronic-structure-evidence` | structure + Bader/charge-density difference + DOS/PDOS/work function/ELF/spin density | Support charge transfer, bonding, band, reducibility, spin, or oxidation-state arguments. |
| `bonding-orbital-analysis` | structure with selected bonds + COHP/COOP/ICOHP, orbital-projected DOS, bond-order or overlap metrics | Support local bonding, antibonding, ligand-field, or adsorbate-surface interaction claims. |
| `reaction-pathway` | key structures + reaction/free-energy profile + TS/vibration/IRC/NEB validation | Support mechanism and kinetic/thermodynamic pathway claims. |
| `electrocatalysis-descriptor` | CHE step diagram, limiting-potential/overpotential bar, volcano/descriptors, active-site structure | Support OER/ORR/HER/CO2RR/NRR-style electrochemical activity claims. |
| `phonon-vibration-stability` | phonon dispersion/DOS, imaginary-mode structure, vibrational frequencies, thermodynamic properties | Support dynamic stability, vibrational assignment, ZPE, entropy, or phonon-derived thermodynamics. |
| `md-observable` | trajectory snapshot + RDF/MSD/VACF/VDOS/density/contact survival/diffusion/time-series | Support finite-temperature, liquid, diffusion, transport, aggregation, or equilibration claims. |
| `mlp-qa-plus-md-observable` | lcurve/parity/PCA/model-deviation + MD observable + representative structures | Show an MLP model is credible enough for the MD observable being reported. |
| `dataset-coverage-or-embedding` | PCA/t-SNE/UMAP, split/source labels, coverage gaps, outlier structures | Diagnose whether training/validation/test or active-learning data cover the target chemistry. |
| `benchmark-validation` | parity/residual/error histograms, convergence tests, ablation comparison, method-vs-reference table | Validate a method, parser, workflow, model, or benchmark arm against a reference. |
| `screening-summary` | workflow schematic + ranked metric + representative hits/failures + filter counts | Summarize high-throughput, candidate-selection, or exploratory screening results. |
| `spectroscopy-characterization` | simulated spectrum + experiment/target comparison + model assignment | Support XRD, IR/Raman, NMR, XAS/XPS, UV-vis, STM, or other observable assignment. |
| `workflow-or-response-summary` | question/claim -> calculation route -> evidence artifact -> conclusion/status | Summarize a reviewer response, project status, benchmark case, or multi-stage workflow. |
| `stage-synthesis` | status table + decisive plots + open follow-up map | Help decide the next calculation wave, not final manuscript claims. |

Common pairings:

- Charge-density-difference or Bader panels often need DOS/PDOS or another orthogonal
  observable before supporting a deep electronic-structure claim.
- MLP-driven MD figures should pair the scientific MD observable with the MLP QA needed
  to trust it: learning curve, held-out parity, force residuals, descriptor PCA, and/or
  model deviation.
- Reaction-pathway and electrocatalysis figures should show both the energy/free-energy
  profile and the structures defining the decisive intermediates or transition states.
  The profile uses thick horizontal plateaus for each intermediate/TS energy and thin
  solid or dashed connectors only as sequence guides. The contract should map every
  reported state name to its source structure image or to a recorded reason for
  omitting that structure from the main figure.
- Screening figures should include representative failures or limitations when those
  determine the safe interpretation.

## Contract checklist

- [ ] The core conclusion is one sentence and does not exceed the evidence.
- [ ] Each panel has a named evidence role; no panel is decorative.
- [ ] The hero panel carries the decisive observation.
- [ ] The layout contract names final width, panel hierarchy, legend/colorbar strategy,
  font-size floor, contrast policy, and crowding risks before plotting.
- [ ] The aesthetic contract names page archetype, visual hierarchy, palette role map,
  legend policy, and background policy before plotting. Use
  `computational-chemistry-figure-style.md` for AICC defaults.
- [ ] Validation panels are present when the claim depends on model quality
  (for example, MLP QA before DPMD observables).
- [ ] Every numeric panel has units, reference state, and sign convention where needed.
- [ ] Structure panels use accepted/final structures and record the source path.
- [ ] Reaction-pathway and electrocatalysis profile panels use thick horizontal
  plateaus for intermediate/TS energies; connectors are thin solid/dashed sequence
  guides, not smooth fitted curves.
- [ ] Each reported reaction state or transition state is paired with a corresponding
  final/accepted structure render near the profile, or the contract records why it is
  moved to SI or omitted.
- [ ] Electronic-structure panels are paired with the model/projection they describe.
- [ ] Limitations or inconclusive panels are labeled in the caption, not only in notes.
- [ ] Text, tick labels, legends, colorbars, structure labels, and panel labels are
  checked against `figure-layout-qa.md` at final size; white-on-white or other
  low-contrast text is fixed before report assembly.
- [ ] The figure does not read like an equal-sized dashboard when one panel carries the
  conclusion; hero/validation/context roles are visible in the composition.
- [ ] Source data and scripts are preserved beside the report manifest or artifact log.
