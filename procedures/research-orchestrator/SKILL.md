description: DISABLED in this fork; do not use (see the fork override at the top of AGENTS.md). Originally: Define and maintain machine-readable research project state for multi-stage computational chemistry work. Use when a project needs task DAGs, artifact registries, decision logs, ready/blocked task checks, or structured handoff between cognitive roles and deterministic tool skills.

# Research Orchestrator

This procedure owns **durable project state, handoffs, readiness, permissions, gates,
and execution ownership**. It does not own the scientific lifecycle
(`comp-chem-workflow`), reviewer-response semantics (`review-response`), or any engine,
structure, HPC, visualization, or report operation. A task's `skill` remains
authoritative for doing and validating that task.

Use it when work is multi-stage, resumable, HPC-backed, shared across agents, or needs
auditable approvals and claims. Skip it for a quick, isolated parse or conversion.

## Control plane

`.research/` is the machine-readable source of truth:

```text
.research/
  project.yaml
  tasks/*.yaml
  artifacts.jsonl
  decisions.jsonl
  events.jsonl
  leases/*.json
  jobs/*.json
```

`workflow.md` or `response-workflow.md` may summarize this state for humans but must
not override it. The protocol records state; it is not a scheduler, database, worker,
or substitute for tool execution.

Core semantics:

- readiness is derived from task state, dependencies, inputs, approvals, leases, and
  output conflicts;
- `completed` records producer completion, `validated` requires the named deterministic
  checker/parser, and `accepted` requires an authorized scientific or human decision;
- plan, structure, result, and report gates release only their matching downstream
  action;
- cognitive review may be parallel, but expensive execution has one claimed owner and
  one exclusive run directory;
- stale leases or recorded jobs are reconciled before any continuation or resubmission;
- critic outcomes can add follow-up nodes, so the DAG may cycle through new evidence.

## Workflow

1. Initialize the project with objective, success criteria, mode, and approval policy.
2. Create task nodes with dependencies, role/permission contract, routed skill,
   required knowledge/checks, inputs, outputs, and execution policy.
3. Register source and generated artifacts; append decisions and events instead of
   rewriting history.
4. Validate state and derive ready/blocked tasks.
5. Before expensive execution, satisfy the applicable plan/structure/pre-submit gates,
   claim the task, and hand execution to its engine and `hpc-submit` skills.
6. Register parser evidence, run result criticism, and either accept a claim, record a
   limitation, or scaffold follow-up tasks.
7. Release final reporting only after its claims and report gate are ready.

Do not put result critics or report gates before the first calculation wave: those
consume evidence that does not yet exist. Candidate structure construction may proceed
before a structure verdict, but engine/HPC consumption waits for the applicable
accepted structure review.

Working state examples live under `examples/minimal-project/`,
`examples/role-handoff-project/`, and the claim/lease example directories.

## Hard guardrails

- Never use state or gate metadata to bypass the routed tool skill's validation.
- Never allow two active owners to write the same run directory or submit the same
  attempt.
- Never resubmit from a stale lease, vanished queue entry, or ambiguous job record
  without reconciliation.
- Structure producers cannot approve their own structure review; claim producers cannot
  self-assert acceptance.
- Final reports consume accepted claims by default. Stage synthesis must remain visibly
  interim and list pending, waived, inconclusive, and `needs-follow-up` items.
- Never store secrets, private connection details, full POTCAR data, or licensed
  potential/force-field contents in `.research/`.
